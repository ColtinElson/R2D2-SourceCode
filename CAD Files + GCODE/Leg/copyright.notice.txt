I'm going to make the design available as a set of Autocad .dwg drawing files with the
understanding that the drawings are copyright to Media-Conversions and are 
not to be used commercially.
(That note also appears on each of the drawings).
I've also put together a set of assembly instructions to help you put the parts together.
Go to www.r2d2.media-conversions.net and follow the links there.
