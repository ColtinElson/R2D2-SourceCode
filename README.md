# R2D2-SourceCode
Here are all the files for the R2D2 project.
MotorCode.py is the main file to run the r2. The SoundCode.py file contains the code to run the sounds (a bit more work needs to be done on it)
The controller uses AntiMicro to run on the pi and i've been using the keyboard.joystick file as the profile. 

The source for the main build of the droid came from http://www.r2d2.media-conversions.net/

The source for the 3D printed dome came from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1395937

All other 3D printed files come from http://astromech.net/droidwiki/Category:3D_Files (Astromech forum account needed to access)
